Project 1 : Using Python, Execute processing systems benchmarking, and then defining a DNN with two or three
fully connected layers and varying the number of neurons in each layer in order to know how accuracy and
inference time vary with different neuron configurations.

â€“ Project 2 : Implementing DNNs compression by using two approaches, first by performing post-training quantization
of a DNN model and second by applying structured pruning of the DNN model.
